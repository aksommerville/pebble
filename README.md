# pebble

A bare-bones alternative to my game platform Egg.
This is an experiment.
I want the thinnest possible host and host/client interface.

This time, our approach is to dump everything on the client where possible:
- Client supplies a framebuffer of a size negotiated via metadata.
- Client produces a PCM stream on demand. Rate and channel count negotiated via metadata and rejectable.
- Host provides timing and four gamepad states, at each update.
- Host provides language, clock, and persistence.
- ~ROM file is copied into client memory initially.~ Client must call for it.

So unlike Egg, there is no built-in renderer or synthesizer.

Build cases:
- External web. We supply a friendly load-your-rom web app.
- Embedded web. Single HTML file, no outer chrome. Suitable for iframing.
- External native. We supply a friendly native emulator app.
- Embedded native. Verbatim rom file linked into an executable with the wasm runtime and everything.
- Full native. Game sources compile natively and link against the native runtime directly. ROM assets embed like the embedded case.
