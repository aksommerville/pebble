# Pebble Image Formats

We provide some client-side image decoders at `src/demo/src/image`.
Clients are of course welcome to implement their own decoders too.

We impose a size limit 32767 for all formats.

## rawimg

Simplest possible thing, so we always have a neat fallback.

```
0000   4 Signature: "\x00rIm"
0004   2 Width 1..0x7fff
0006   2 Height 1..0x7fff
0008   1 Pixel size in bits: 1,2,4,8,16,24,32
0009
```

Followed by pixels, LRTB, rows padded to one byte.
Sub-byte pixels are packed big-endianly.
Short pixels are not allowed; the file length must match the header exactly.

## qoi

[Official spec](https://qoiformat.org)

For RGBA images. Decent run-length compression, overall performance is not great.

Integers are big-endian.

Header:
```
0000   4 Signature: "qoif"
0004   4 Width. 1..0x7fff for consistency with our other formats.
0008   4 Height. ''
000c   1 Channel count (3,4)
000d   1 Colorspace (0,1)=(sRGB,linear)
000e
```

Maintain a cache of 64 pixels, indexed by a hash:
```
index_position = (r * 3 + g * 5 + b * 7 + a * 11) % 64
```

Payload is in chunks distinguishable by their leading byte.
Check in order:
```
11111110 rrrrrrrr gggggggg bbbbbbbb          : QOI_OP_RGB. Alpha from previous pixel.
11111111 rrrrrrrr gggggggg bbbbbbbb aaaaaaaa : QOI_OP_RGBA
00iiiiii                                     : QOI_OP_INDEX. Emit cache[i].
01rrggbb                                     : QOI_OP_DIFF. (r,g,b) are (-2..1), difference from previous pixel.
10gggggg rrrrbbbb                            : QOI_OP_LUMA. (g) in (-32..31), (r,b) in (-8..7)+(g), difference from previous pixel.
11llllll                                     : QOI_OP_RUN. Emit previous pixel (l+1) times, 1..62. 63 and 64 are illegal.
```

End of file:
```
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
```

## rlead

Adaptive RLE, my own invention for 1-bit images.

Header:
```
0000   4 Signature: "\x00rld"
0004   2 Width 1..0x7fff
0006   2 Height 1..0x7fff
0008   1 Flags:
          f8 Reserved, zero
          04 Alpha. Otherwise gray.
          02 Initial color
          01 Filter
0009
```

Followed by payload, which must be read bitwise big-endianly:
 - First read a 3-bit leading word.
 - Emit so many pixels, plus 1. ie 1..8 pixels.
 - If the leading word is 7, begin extension words:
 - - Increment word length by 1. ie first extension word is 4 bits.
 - - Read a word of that length, and emit so many pixels. Do not add 1.
 - - If the word contains a zero, the run is over.
 - - Otherwise, do another extension word (increasing the word size by 1 bit each time).
 
This arrangement has a clean break-even point at 3-pixel runs.
Meaning, runs of 1 or 2 pixels encode longer than raw, and runs of 4 or more encode smaller.
 
Payload is allowed to be short, anything unvisited is zero (regardless of Initial color).
At the limit, a straight black image may have no payload at all.
 
If (Filter) set, each row must be XOR'd against the previous row.
Do this before encoding or after decoding.
